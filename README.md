### Maya Archeology Web Project

A research project done in collaboration with UCSD's [Engineers for Exploration](https://e4e.ucsd.edu/maya-archaeology), taking scanned models of South American caves, and making them visible and navigable in a 3D Web VR environment. I was the sole contributor on the web project, though I received resources and guidance from mentors in E4E. A Typescript project that heavily uses the [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) Engine, run with [WebPack-Dev-Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) and Docker.
